# metarr

React web app to check any airport's METAR.

Uses HTML5 Geolocation API to get nearest METAR stations to your position if desired.

Shows both raw METAR data and shows small insights of the parsed conditions.

Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with the new App Router.

Airport data is sourced from [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/) and comes with no guarantee of accuracy or fitness for use. METAR data is sourced from [AVWX](https://info.avwx.rest/).
